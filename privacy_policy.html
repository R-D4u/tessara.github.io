					<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
					<p>
						This privacy policy applies to the Tetrino app (hereby referred to
						as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by R&D4u
						(hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported
						service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".
					</p>

					<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
					<p>
						The Application collects information when you download and use it.
						This information may include information such as:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)</li>
						<li>
							The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of
							your visit, the time spent on those pages
						</li>
						<li>The time spent on the Application</li>
						<li>The operating system you use on your mobile device</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The Application does not gather precise information about the
						location of your mobile device.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Application collects your device's location, which helps the
						Service Provider determine your approximate geographical location
						and make use of in the following ways:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Geolocation Services:</strong> The Service Provider
							utilizes location data to provide features such as personalized
							content, relevant recommendations, and location-based services.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Analytics and Improvements:</strong> Aggregated and
							anonymized location data helps the Service Provider to analyze
							user behavior, identify trends, and improve the overall
							performance and functionality of the Application.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> Periodically, the Service
							Provider may transmit anonymized location data to external
							services. These services assist them in enhancing the Application
							and optimizing their offerings.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact
						you from time to time to provide you with important information,
						required notices, and marketing promotions.
					</p>
					<p>
						For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service
						Provider may require you to provide us with certain personally
						identifiable information. The information that the Service Provider
						requests will be retained by them and used as described in this
						privacy policy.
					</p>

					<h2>Third Party Access</h2>
					<p>
						Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to
						external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the
						Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your
						information with third parties in the ways that are described in
						this privacy statement.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that
						have their own Privacy Policy about handling data. Below are the
						links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers
						used by the Application:

						Collected Information:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar
							legal process;
						</li>
						<li>

							protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others,
							investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
						</li>
						<li>
							with their trusted service providers who work on their behalf, do
							not have an independent use of the information we disclose to
							them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this
							privacy statement.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>
					<p>
						You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily
						by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as
						may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile
						application marketplace or network.
					</p>

					<h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>
					<p>

						<a href="mailto:rnd4udev@gmail.com">rnd4udev@gmail.com</a> and they
						will respond in a reasonable time.
					</p>

					<h2>Children</h2>
					<p>
						The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly
						solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. The
						Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable
						information from children under 13 years of age. In the case the
						Service Provider discovers that a child under 13 has provided
						personal information, the Service Provider will immediately delete
						this from their servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are
						aware that your child has provided us with personal information,
						please contact the Service Provider (<a
							href="mailto:rnd4udev@gmail.com"
							>rnd4udev@gmail.com</a
						>) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions.
					</p>

					<h2>Security</h2>
					<p>
						The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the
						confidentiality of your information. The Service Provider provides
						physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect
						information the Service Provider processes and maintains.
					</p>

					<h2>Changes</h2>
					<p>
						This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason.
						The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy
						Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are
						advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as
						continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
					</p>
					<p>This privacy policy is effective as of 2024-05-17.</p>

					<h2>Your Consent</h2>

						By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of
						your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as
						amended by us.
